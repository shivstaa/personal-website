All data is stored in a Postgres database via Google Cloud which allows for real-time commands such as event notification signup and removal, and event creation, modification, and deletion. The bot is also able to utilize timezones to be able to ping users at the appropriate time through the Google Cloud notifications extension and Python time-date libraries.",
